<h1>About Chris</h1>
<p>Hello there,</p>

<p>My name is Christian Prado. I am a Certified Cybersecurity Practitioner who is learning Secure Web and Software Development.<br />
  I got interested in these skills to better understand the impact that programming has in a digital infrastructure. Moreover, I believe<br />
  that programming is an open door to bring great solutions to humanity and the ecosystem we live.
</p>

<p>I never programmed anything before. Oh wait! Maybe, the new generic remote control, to make it work might be the closest example.<br />
  Not a great example actually, but I want to make this an experience to those overwhelmed by programming. I want to share my journey<br />
  making clear that we all can code. I hope you like this!<br />
</p>

<p>I am still learning a bunch of concepts and demos thanks to Udemy, more specifically Dr. Angela who is an amazing teacher. TY Angela!<br />
  This site will be under constant development; therefore, you can expect a lot of gaps or changes that I will be addressing.<br />
  Thank you for visiting my website, I hope you like everything I will apply during my learning journey.</p>

<p>You can check out the progression I have made so far by visiting the link below! :) </p>
